# More Generative AI Samples With Postgres

Below is a list of other sample generative AI applications using Postgres as a database.

## AI Agent Using Text-To-SQL interface

The sample shows how to create an AI agent that uses the text-to-SQL interface to interact with Postgres. The agent takes a user question in a natural language and converts it a SQL query. Then, it executes the query over Postgres to get required information or to perform a particular action.

## ChatGPT Plugin Using Postgres pgvector

Learn how to create custom ChatGPT plugins using PostgreSQL pgvector and launch the plugins on the OpenAI marketplace.

We'll start with the basics, developing a RAG-based gen AI application that uses an LLM, PostgreSQL pgvector, and Spring AI to search for information requested by users. Then, we'll introduce capabilities that will let the AI perform actions following user prompts. Finally, we'll turn the application into a plugin and launch it on the OpenAI marketplace.
